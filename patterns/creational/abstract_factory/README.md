# Abstract factory pattern

The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual
factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

When to use:

* When the business logic must work with different kinds of related products,
regardless of specific product classes.
* When the program is already using the Factory Method, but the new changes will
involve the implementation of new types of products.

But:

* Complicates the program code due to the introduction of many additional
classes.
* Requires all types of food in every variation.
