# Composite pattern

The compositor is a structural design pattern that allows you to group multiple objects into a tree structure and then work with it as if it were a single object.

When to use:
- You need to imagine a tree structure of objects.
- Clients need to treat simple and complex objects in a consistent way.

But:
 - 1 Creates an overly general design for the class.
