# Facade pattern

The facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex system of classes, a library, or a framework.

When to use:
 - You need to present a simple or stripped-down interface to a complex subsystem.
 - You want to decompose a subsystem into separate layers.

But:
- The facade runs the risk of becoming a God object tied to all classes of the program.

## Output

> Ordering at a ramen restaurant is not easy. They usually use vending machines, so you have to: choose a dish (if you can read Japanese), put some money, get a ticket, give it to the chef. This facade will help me not to starve to death.

Chosen miso ramen

Inseted money

Ticket created: miso ramen

Chef got a ticket and started cooking miso ramen
