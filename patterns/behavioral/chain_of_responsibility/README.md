# Chain of Responsibility pattern

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain

When to use:
 - Your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
 - Itâ€™s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order
 - The set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime

But:
 - Some requests may end up unhandled
