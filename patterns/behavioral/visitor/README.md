# Visitor pattern

The Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

When to use:
 - You need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree).
 - To clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.
 - A behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.

But:
 - You need to update all visitors each time a class gets added to or removed from the element hierarchy.
 - Visitors might lack the necessary access to the private fields and methods of the elements that theyâ€™re supposed to work with.

## Output
