# Observer pattern

Thr Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

When to use:
 - Changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
 - Some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

But:
 - Subscribers are notified in random order.
